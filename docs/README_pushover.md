# steltic_pushover — Pushover Analyst for the Steltic Grok Bot set

Turns a finished **Steltic** HR design package (AISC 360/341, elastic OpenSees model) into a
**nonlinear static (pushover) supplement**: converts `model_opensees.py` to a concentrated-plasticity
model, pushes it in X and Y with a first-mode pattern and P-Δ, evaluates the capacity curve to the
ASCE 41 nonlinear static procedure (target displacement, component acceptance IO/LS/CP, mechanism) and
FEMA P-695-style overstrength/ductility, and writes `pushover_report.html` next to `report.html`.

It is meant to be driven by a Grok Bot, **Pushover Analyst**, that sits next to Query file
manager / HR Steel App / CFS Steel App / DDM Steel App (see `prompts/bootstrap_prompts.md`). The bot supplies the
one thing this code refuses to invent: the component modelling parameters and acceptance criteria,
retrieved verbatim from ASCE/SEI 41-23 → ANSI/AISC 342-22 through Query file manager.

> **Prototype. Not for construction.** `pushover/hinge_params.json` ships with `verified: false` and
> placeholder values; every report carries a red banner until the bot has replaced them from the
> licensed standards. All results must be independently checked and sealed by a licensed PE.

## 3-D viewer (pushover_viewer_3d.html)

Every run also writes **`pushover_viewer_3d.html`** — a self-contained, interactive 3-D viewer in the style of Steltic's own
`viewer_3d.html` (three.js r128 vendored, MIT; no network, opens from disk). It is one of the three viewers of the
**Steltic viewer bundle** (Pushover · NLRHA · DDM): the same geometry, orbit controls, dark engineering palette,
component-state colours and panel layout in all three, so an engineer can open Steltic's viewer and the three analysis
viewers side by side and read the building the same way in each.

The capacity curve is the scrubber: drag along V–δroof (or the Time slider / ▶ play) and the building takes the
recorded shape at that step with every hinge and brace coloured by its ASCE 41 state (elastic / yielded / > IO / > LS /
> CP / beyond b; braces: buckled Δ > Δc, tension yield). Buttons jump to δt BSE-1N, δt BSE-2N, Vmax and the end of the
push; the chart carries the idealised bilinear curve, the design base shear V (R-reduced) and the wind base shear as
reference lines. Right panel: values at the step, story drift bars, component census, NSP summary (Te, Sa, δt,
μstrength ≤ μmax, Ω, μT, worst D/C at each hazard level).

Common to the bundle: drag to orbit, right-drag / shift-drag to pan, wheel to zoom, click a member for its data
(section, level, state, Steltic governing combination and demand), `R` resets the camera, space plays / pauses, the
Plan / Elev X / Elev Y buttons snap the view, the Deformation slider scales the rigid-diaphragm shape, and the Show
toggles hide columns / beams / braces / slabs / supports / undeformed ghost. Component states use one palette everywhere:
grey elastic · yellow yielded · purple brace buckled · amber > IO/LS · red > CP · dark red beyond the valid range b.
**Hinge dots** — solid camera-facing discs at the member ends (braces: mid-length) wherever a plastic hinge has formed
at the shown step; dot colour follows the state, or `red = any plastic hinge` from the Hinge dots selector. The legend
sits under the right-hand panel; the member info box opens bottom-left.

**Module selector / bundle hub.** The strip at the top of the left panel (Steltic · Pushover · NLRHA · DDM) is a
selector: the current module is highlighted, the others are clickable links to the sibling viewers when those files
exist next to this one (`viewer_3d.html`, `pushover/pushover_viewer_3d.html`, `nlrha/nlrha_viewer_3d.html`,
`ddm_viewer_3d.html`, checked when the page opens) and greyed out with a strike-through when they do not. Every run also
writes **`steltic_viewer_bundle.html`** in the package root — one page with the four viewers in tabs (each loaded on
first use and kept alive, so flipping is instant); modules missing from the folder are greyed out there too, and the
module strip inside each embedded viewer switches the tab. The `⧉` chip in a standalone viewer opens the hub.

## Component parameters: the two table forms

`hinge_params.json` is read at run time (`--params my_file.json` for a project copy — keep the repository file a placeholder; the
bot fills a per-project copy from Query file manager). Beams accept two forms: the member table (`a_over_thetay`,
`b_over_thetay`, IO/LS/CP as multiples of θ<sub>y</sub> — AISC 342 Table C2.2 form) or, with `"mode": "fr_connection"`, the
FR-connection table (AISC 342 Table C5.5 form): `a_expr` in `h, tw, bf, tf, Lb, ry, L, d` (e.g. the RBS X₂ expression),
`a_max`, `b_abs`, `c_residual`, `IO_frac_of_a`, `LS_frac_of_b`, `CP_frac_of_b`, `Lb_over_ry` or `Lb_divisor`, optional
`rbs_c_frac_bf` / `rbs_c_in` (M<sub>CE</sub> from the reduced section, AISC 358 Eq. 5.8-4) and a `modifiers` list
(`factor`, `why`, optional `sections`) for the C5.4a.1.a.1 adjustments. Columns accept `a_expr`/`b_expr`/`c_expr` in
`h/tw`, `L/ry`, `PG/Pye` with `a_max`/`b_max` caps, `theta_y_uses_Mpce` (Eq. C3-15 with M<sub>CE</sub>) and
`non_highly_ductile_reduction`. A `compactness` block (AISC 341 Table D1.1 form with F<sub>ye</sub>) classifies every
section as highly / moderately ductile / other. `numerics.post_cap_ratio` (default 0.15 ≈ vertical drop) is the
tail-protocol rung 3 — raising it is a disclosed modelling change.

## Panel zones (opt-in)

Default `panel_zones.mode` is **`rigid`** (centreline model, no behaviour change). Set `"mode": "scissors"` in
`hinge_params.json` (or a project `--params` copy) to enable scissors-style flexible panel zones at **FR**
moment-frame joints only (unreleased beam + column ends):

- Column stack stays on the joint node; FR beam ends attach to a coincident beam-side node (not an RD slave).
- One 6-DOF `zeroLength` between column joint and beam-side node: rigid on translations / torsion / unused
  flexure, PZ spring on rot DOF(s) 4/5 (`strong_rot_dof`), kip-in-sec. **Not** `equalDOF` (conflicts with
  `rigidDiaphragm` under Transformation — caused spurious short T1 / collapsed base shear before the fix).
- `material`: `"elastic"` (smoke / K<sub>θ</sub> = G·t<sub>p</sub>·d<sub>c</sub>·d<sub>b</sub>) or `"hysteretic"`
  (Gupta–Krawinkler trilinear). Optional `K_theta` or `hysteretic` envelope overrides; `doubler_t_in` adds to t<sub>w</sub>.
- IMK end hinges remain at member ends. **Do not** also apply the AISC 342 C5.4a.1.a.1(b) PZ ductility modifier
  when scissors is on. This is **not** a full 8-bar Krawinkler rectangle (no geometric rigid offsets of beam/column depth).

Same builder feeds NSP and NLRHA (`nlrha/model.py` imports `pushover.nonlinear_model`).

## Command line

```

python -m pushover run     <package.zip | folder> [--out DIR] [--dirs X Y] [--max-drift 0.08]
                                                  [--site-class D] [--params hinge_params.json] [--system SMF]
                                                  [--tail auto|fine_step|arclength|none] [--post-cap-ratio 0.5]
```

## Examples

`examples/SMF6_B02` (space SMF, drift-governed) and, in the companion `steltic_nlrha` repo, `examples/Ex18_R3`
(R = 3 X-braced frame — exercises the brace model; Ω 6.5 / 6.2, braces buckle at levels 5–7 at δ<sub>t</sub>).

## What the SMF6_B02 example shows (SMF6_B02: B02 archetype, 6-storey space SMF, R=8, SDS=1.0 g)

The B02 archetype is drift-sized with W14X311 columns and W33X130 beams at every joint, so the
pushover finds a system overstrength Ω ≈ 15–17 against the ELF base shear (Ω<sub>0</sub> = 3) and
target displacements of ~0.7% (BSE-1N) and ~1.0% (BSE-2N) of height with the hinges still near yield
— exactly the kind of finding the linear package cannot make on its own, and a warning that
Ω<sub>0</sub>Q<sub>E</sub> is not an upper bound for its capacity-designed elements.

## Limitations of this prototype (roadmap)

- Braces: phenomenological `corotTruss` + `Hysteretic` axial backbone (ASCE 41 Table 9-8 form, placeholder values,
  K = 1 on the recorded brace length); no fracture, no cyclic degradation. EBF links, BRB cores and SPSW panels are
  not modelled. HSS local slenderness is not checked (no wall thickness in aisc_shapes.csv).
- Panel zones default **rigid**; opt-in `panel_zones.mode=scissors` (joint rotational spring). Bare centreline, no composite slab, no fracture, fixed bases as in the linear model. Full 8-bar Krawinkler is not implemented.
- Gravity spread equally over each level's column nodes (footprint from node extents); use
  `model_static.py` tributary loads for irregular plans.
- Higher-mode (LDP) supplement and the force-controlled Eq. 7-38 check are reported as open items.
- Descending branch: the tool first checks whether hinges reached rotation *b* (a valid P-695 end point),
  then escalates through a fine-step and an arc-length rung; only if both fail does it flag `lower_bound`
  and hand the decision (`--post-cap-ratio`, a modelling change) to the user via the bot.

## India fibre descending branch

Default `--max-drift` is **0.10** for India fibre runs (else 0.08). IN_Ex1 at 0.02 hit
`status=max_drift` without a descending branch — raise `--max-drift` (0.12–0.15) before
consenting to rung-3 `--post-cap-ratio 0.5` (modelling change). Modal pattern now selects the
first mode with meaningful participating mass in the push direction (skips ~0% soft modes)
**and** rejects unrealistically short periods below a numerical T-floor of **0.02 s**
(engineering sanity filter ≈ 50 Hz — **not** an IS 1893 / ASCE Ta provision). IN_Ex3
Chennai Y previously stuck on mode 10 at T≈0.001 s / ~100% mass; the T-floor prefers a
real building sway mode (same spirit as the Ex1 mass pick).

India COMPLETE-gate honesty: pushover run writes `complete_gate_disclosures.json` under `--out`
(`india_nsp_acceptance_tables` found:false, prefer fibre / hinge_params UNVERIFIED;
`asce_16_1_2_drift_relief_analogue` found:false → feedback drift loop ineligible). Do not invent
NSP acceptance or §16.1.2 drift-relief text.
