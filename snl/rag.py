"""rag.py -- the standards search the Review step grounds its clauses with (stdlib only).

Same wire contract as HR Steel's search tool: POST RAG_API_URL {"query", "collection", "top_k", "clause",
"chapter"} -> {"results": [{"text", "source", "section", "title", "page", "score", "authoritative"}], "note"}.
India fork: RAG_API_URL is the IS corpus bridge (the hub's IS corpus module, rag_server.py, started by the hub for
the run and passed as RAG_API_URL; standalone, any server with the same wire contract). The corpus is the user's own,
built in the hub from their licensed BIS PDFs. Only IS
documents are searched (owner ruling D3: IS standards only, no foreign design basis); the collection names are
the engineering_standards_IS* names of snl/india_collections.py. Never point this at the US corpus.
Empty RAG_API_URL -> search() says so and the review goes on from the model's own knowledge, flagged.

The search carries the same retrieval skill HR Steel's tool has, so the model is never left to
guess what a zero-hit answer means (2026-09-20: a review spent seven of its eight searches on a
document that had never been converted on that PC, was told "not in the corpus" seven times, and
cited it from memory):

  * before the first search the server's /healthz says which documents the corpus actually holds;
    a document that is absent is reported as a CORPUS GAP at once, the call is not counted against
    the budget, and one wide search across the documents that ARE present is made instead;
  * a miss climbs a ladder before it is allowed to be a miss -- as asked; without the clause /
    chapter filter; the id as an exact lookup; any document -- and the answer says which rung, and
    which document, supplied the passages.
